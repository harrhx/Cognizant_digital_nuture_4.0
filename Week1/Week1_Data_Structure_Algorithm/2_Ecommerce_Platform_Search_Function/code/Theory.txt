Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
Big O notation is a way to describe how the runtime or memory usage of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. It helps us compare algorithms by focusing on their worst-case performance, allowing us to choose the one that will scale most efficiently.

Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
Best Case: The item you are searching for is the very first one you check.

Average Case: The item is found somewhere in the middle of the dataset.

Worst Case: The item is the very last one you check, or it's not in the dataset at all.

Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
Linear Search: Has a time complexity of O(n). In the worst case, it must check every single item in a list of 'n' items.

Binary Search: Has a time complexity of O(log n). It repeatedly halves the search interval, making it dramatically faster for large datasets.

Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.
Binary search is far more suitable for a large e-commerce platform. Its O(log n) time complexity means it can find products among millions of items almost instantly.

While linear search is simpler to implement, its O(n) performance is too slow for a good user experience. The only requirement for binary search is that the product data must be kept sorted, a small price to pay for the immense speed advantage it provides.
