Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
Data structures and algorithms are essential for managing large inventories because they ensure efficiency. The right data structure allows for fast searching, adding, and updating of products, which is critical when dealing with thousands or millions of items. Without them, operations would be too slow, making the system unusable.

Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
Two common data structures are suitable here:

ArrayList: A simple list that stores products in order. It's easy to use but can be slow for searching because you might have to check every item.

HashMap: A structure that stores products using a unique key, like a productId. It is extremely fast for finding a specific product by its ID.

Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
The time complexity depends heavily on the chosen structure. Let's assume we use a HashMap where the key is the productId.

Add: Adding a new product is an O(1) operation on average, as the HashMap directly calculates where to store it.

Update: Finding a product by its ID and updating it is also O(1) on average.

Delete: Deleting a product using its ID is also O(1) on average.

If we used an ArrayList and had to find a product by ID, the update and delete operations would be O(n) because we would have to search the list.

Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
The primary optimization is to choose the right data structure from the start. For an inventory system where you frequently look up items by a unique productId, using a HashMap is the best optimization. It guarantees that adding, updating, and deleting specific products are nearly instantaneous, regardless of how large the inventory grows. Any other approach, like using a simple list, would require more complex and less efficient search algorithms.
