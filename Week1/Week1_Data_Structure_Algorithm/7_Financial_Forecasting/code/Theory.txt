Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.
Recursion is when a function solves a problem by calling itself with a slightly smaller version of the problem. It repeats this until it reaches a simple "base case" that can be solved directly. This approach simplifies complex problems by breaking them into smaller, identical pieces.

Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
For a simple forecast over 'n' years, the recursive function calls itself 'n' times. This results in a time complexity of O(n), or linear time. This means the calculation time grows directly in proportion to the number of years you forecast. It's efficient for this type of problem.

Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
Recursive solutions can be optimized using memoization. This technique involves storing, or "caching," the results of each sub-problem. When the function needs a result it has already calculated, it retrieves it from memory instead of re-computing it. This avoids redundant work and dramatically improves performance.
